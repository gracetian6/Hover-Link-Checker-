# Hover-Link-Checker-
Hover Link Checker is a google chrome extension that checks all the links that you hover over to make sure that they work. It automatically finds and disables dead links you hover on. 

# Motivation
Most link checkers for chrome extensions don't check links automatically and add very distracting blocks of color to identify the invalid and valid links. They are not geared for every day browsing. Hover link checker is more efficient in that it quickly checks links only when you hover over them, instead of checking all the hundreds of unnecessary links on a webpage. It also allows you to customize how links appear. So instead of bright red and green blocks, the dead links can be made to be crossed out and unclcickable, and valid links can be made to turn green for a certain amount of time. 

# Installation 
You can install Hover Link Checker through Google Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-link-checker/bfnpcgcodakabmhijhfeajicpngggefk 

# Contributing 
To edit and test, you can download files and upload as a folder on chrome://extensions
Check out the response of the links by looking at "Network" in Developer Tools in chrome while hovering over link. If the extension is working, there will be new log when you hover over a link.
